      "description": "We were contracted to advise and improve the lighting in the main hall. The lighting that they were using was 500W halogen flood lights which meant they had very high energy bills and unnecessary maintenance issues.  Our lighting design team used an LED high power flood light with an energy saving of 450w per fitting, so not only a massive saving but a manufacturer's warranty of 5 years. The church are very happy as the savings they have made have allowed them to invest in other areas.",
